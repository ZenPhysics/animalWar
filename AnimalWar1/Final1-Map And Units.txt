Final Project: Turn-Based Tactics Map
Due: April 17th, 2019 before 5:40 PM

Map Generation And Unit Acquisition

For the turn-based tactics game you're building, create map building blocks (prefabs).  I
recommend that these building blocks be tiles so that you can create a grid-based map;
however, you are not required to use square tiles.  Hex-based or other map types are
allowed, but it will be easier to work with square block tiles.

-Different terrain types
	-Create a different map tile prefab for each terrain type in your design document
	-Don't forget to create a building block for each player's "base"
		-This will be the final goal of the game--to occupy/destroy the enemy's base
	-Each different terrain will have a different graphical representation
		-You don't need to use artist-level quality graphics, but be sure that each type
		of terrain is clearly distinguishable at a glance.
		-You are welcome to use standard assets to accomplish this
	-Consider how each of your tile prefabs will keep track of their unique benefits/penalties
		-Possibilities:
		-Movement cost per tile (Low movement cost for smooth terrain, high cost for rough terrain?)
		-Provides/does not provide cover
		-Keep a list of units that can travel this tile (all others cannot)
		-Fuel recovered per turn while a unit is standing here
		-Resource gained per turn while this tile is 'owned' by a player
-You are required to submit ONE of the following (A map generator or 3 playable static maps):
	-A random map generator
		-You don't have to build a map generator, but I recommend you do this to make things easier on yourself
		-A map generator does not have to be complex, but it should automatically place tiles and populate them
		with proper data
		-Enemy bases should be on opposite sides of the map
		-Consider adding 'smart' code that will group similar tile types together to create logical terrain
	-3 Playable pre-made maps
		-Enemy bases should be on opposite sides of the map
		-Maps should seem geographically logical (patches of water among patches of mountains don't make sense)
-Map considerations:
	-Consider how resources will be earned/gathered/gained
		-Money earned through enemy kills?
		-Control resource areas (gold mine/oil field/etc.)?
		-Make allowances on your maps for the resource gathering process
	-Consider how each unit will move
		-Have your maps make sense for any unit type to be able to traverse the map in a reasonable manner
	-Each tile should keep track of its location in the map (such as using row/column)
-Unit generation and acquisition
	-Create a prefab for each of your unit types
	-Each prefab should be able to keep track of its own faction, health, attributes, strengths/weaknesses
	-Assign a resource cost to each unit
	-Create UI so that each player can:
		-See how much resource he/she owns
		-Click on their base or click a button to open the build/purchase/train menu
		-Browse the available units for his/her faction
		-Purchase/build/train units (make sure that the player has enough resource before allowing purchase)
	-Newly created units should spawn at or next to the player's base
	-You decide: Can a player build multiple units per turn?  Or only one?  How will that affect strategy in your game?
